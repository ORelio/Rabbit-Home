# Define a list of remote controlled plugs
# This module implements protocol for plugs having 5 "channel" switches and 5 "ABCDE" switches

# Most 433Mhz sockets having this config should work fine with this module
# Note that the "codesend" command must be installed - https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils
# Note that this module can address plugs having more than one "ABCDE" switch set,
# unlike the stock remote control provided with the plugs.

# Define 433MHz plugs as follow:
# DisplayName=channel:letter(s)
# ExamplePlugStandard=01010:A
# ExamplePlugHidden=01010:ABCDE

TV=01010:A
Lamp=01010:B
Heater=01010:C
